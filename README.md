# Guide to Vercel Backend Setup and Serverless Deployment

This README provides detailed instructions for setting up a backend on Vercel, focusing on adapting code for serverless operations and deploying applications efficiently.

## 1. Setting Up Vercel

- Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- Install the Vercel CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```
- Authenticate via the CLI:
  ```bash
  vercel login
  ```

## 2. Preparing Your Code for Serverless

- Organize your code into API routes. Each route file will be an independent Lambda function.
- Example structure:
  ```
  /api
      /users.js       # Endpoint for user operations
      /products.js    # Endpoint for product operations
  ```

### Sample API Route (`/api/users.js`)

```javascript
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    const { query } = req;
    res.status(200).json({ message: `Hello ${query.name}!` });
};
```

## 3. Deployment

- Link your project to Vercel:
  ```bash
  vercel
  ```
- Deploy changes:
  ```bash
  vercel --prod
  ```

## 4. Creating Serverless API Routes

Use Node.js to create API routes. Vercel automatically handles routing based on file names and directories in the `/api` directory.

### Environment Variables

- Define secrets and environment variables:
  ```bash
  vercel secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>
  ```
- Use them in your code via `process.env`:
  ```javascript
  const secretValue = process.env.SECRET_NAME;
  ```

## 5. Monitoring and Logs

- Monitor your deployments and view logs through the Vercel dashboard or using the Vercel CLI:
  ```bash
  vercel logs <deployment-url>
  ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully set up a backend on Vercel and adapt your application for efficient serverless deployment. Ensure your API functions are stateless to fit the serverless model.
